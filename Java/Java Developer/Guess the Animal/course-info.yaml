language: English
summary: 'Artificial intelligence is not just a smart system: it''s a smart system
  capable of self-learning. In this project, you will create a simple interactive
  game where the computer will try to guess the animal that the person has in mind
  with the help of yes or no questions. During the game, the computer will extend its
  knowledge base by learning new facts about animals and using this information in
  the next game.<br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/132?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/132</a>'
