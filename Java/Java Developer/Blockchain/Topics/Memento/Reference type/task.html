   Creating snapshots of the internal state of an object is pretty straightforward, but sometimes its fields may be of reference types. That's why you should be careful not to overlook such situations. This time your task is to implement the Memento class which acts as a storage for the single field of the Originator class, as well as the corresponding methods to get and restore the state. The Caretaker logic is already implemented.
